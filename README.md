# Bytes

This crate is strongly inspired from the tokio bytes crate. You can find it [here](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes).

## Motivation

This crate is created as a utility tool for a web server. The idea is to create a web server in rust with no dependancies.

## Disclaimer

This crate do not intend to replace any other crates, it is for educational purposes only.

## TODO

- [] Switch the in memory management from RC to Hazard Pointers (might
  be more efficient)
